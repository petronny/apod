{"date":"2020-11-29","explanation":"Could you survive a jump off the tallest cliff in the Solar System? Quite possibly.  Verona Rupes on Uranus' moon Miranda is estimated to be 20 kilometers deep -- ten times the depth of the Earth's Grand Canyon.   Given Miranda's low gravity, it would take about 12 minutes for a thrill-seeking adventurer to fall from the top, reaching the bottom at the speed of a racecar -- about 200 kilometers per hour.   Even so, the fall might be survivable given proper airbag protection.  The featured image of Verona Rupes was captured by the passing Voyager 2 robotic spacecraft in 1986.  How the giant cliff was created remains unknown, but is possibly related to a large impact or tectonic surface motion.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2011/TallestCliff_Voyager2_1002.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Verona Rupes: Tallest Known Cliff in the Solar System","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2011/TallestCliff_Voyager2_1002.jpg"}
