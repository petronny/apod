  "explanation": "What caused the bubbles and arcs in NGC 2359?\r The main suspect is the Wolf-Rayet star\r in the center of one of the bubbles - visible slightly below and\r to the right of the center of the above photograph.\r Most Wolf-Rayet stars are known to be massive, highly luminous\r stars that continually cast off material in a stellar wind - which\r commonly form bubbles\r in the interstellar medium.\r But the unusual structure of the NGC 2359 arcs\r indicate something more complex\r is going on. Is the star moving supersonically?\r Is there another energetic star in the vicinity?  Future observations\r may give more pieces to this picturesque puzzle.\r",
