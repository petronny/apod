  "explanation": "One day our Sun may look like this.  The Helix Nebula is the closest example of a planetary nebula created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star.  The outer gasses of the star expelled into space appear from our vantage point as if we are looking down a helix.  The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce.   The Helix Nebula, given a technical designation of NGC 7293, lies 450 light-years away towards the constellation of Aquarius and spans 1.5 light-years.  The above image was taken with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii, USA.  A close-up of the inner edge of the Helix Nebula shows unusual gas knots of unknown origin.",
