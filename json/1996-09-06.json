  "explanation": "\r What is the largest known\r impact crater in the Solar System?\r Over 1300 miles across, the South Pole-Aitken\r Basin on the farside\r of Earth's Moon holds that distinction.\r Circled above in a false color mosaic\r of Clementine images it was caused when\r an asteroid or\r comet sized object\r crashed into the surface, penetrating the lunar mantle.\r \r In general, the rocky terrestrial planets and moons are scarred\r and battered from frequent repeated bombardment by large objects during our\r Solar System's early years.\r On Earth, continuous geological activity\r has hidden much of the damage,\r but the surface of the smaller,\r less active Moon bears testimony to a\r shared history of fierce and frequent impacts.\r At the present time in the vicinity of Earth,\r the bombardment continues -\r fortunately at\r a greatly reduced rate.\r \r",
