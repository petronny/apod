  "explanation": "Hale-Bopp may be the most photographed comet in history.  Above, our photogenic giant flying snowball appeared last month as a backdrop to the \"Cinque Torri\" Mountains near Contina d'Ampezzo, Italy.  Although the comet is still fairly bright, it is fading as it recedes from the Sun, and is now more easily visible from Earth's southern hemisphere.  Having shed a few meters of ice and rock from its surface, Comet Hale-Bopp will coast to the outer Solar System, and return again in another 2400 years.",
