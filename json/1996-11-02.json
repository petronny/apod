  "explanation": "NGC 253 is a normal spiral galaxy seen here\r almost sideways. It is the largest member of the Sculptor Group of Galaxies,\r the nearest group to our own Local Group of Galaxies.\r NGC 253\r appears visually as one of the brightest spirals\r on the sky, and is easily visible in southern hemisphere with\r a good pair of binoculars. The type \"Sc\" galaxy is\r about 10 million light years distant. NGC 253 is considered a \"starburst\" galaxy\r because of high star formation rates and dense dust clouds in its nucleus.\r The energetic nuclear region\r is seen to glow in X-ray and gamma-ray light.\r",
