  "explanation": "The unusual geometry of this stellar nebula creates somewhat of a mystery. At the nebula's center is a young binary star system that probably created the nebula, but how? This type of nebula shows a \"bipolar flow\" which carries a significant amount of mass away from the central stars.  It has been speculated that the central stars create a pair of jets that precess like a spinning top.  These jets might throw gas into a thick disk which we see here edge on - so that it appears to us as a rectangle. The nebula emission is also unusual in that some of the infrared light it emits might be associated with unusual carbon-containing molecules.",
