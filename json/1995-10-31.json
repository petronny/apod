  "explanation": "Orson Welles became an instant legend on Halloween in 1938 for his radio dramatization of H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds\". Some listeners who did not realize it was a theatrical production were driven to near panic by this fictional account of invaders from Mars. In the story, as in the above Hubble Space Telescope image, Mars was at \"opposition\", its point of closest approach to the Earth, a distance of some 65 million miles. For the Martians, it was imagined that this was a good time to invade.  For astronomers, opposition is a good time to study the red planet and this HST image, represents the clearest view of Mars ever for an Earth telescope. The icy north polar cap is visible at the top of the picture as well as a veil of white clouds along the planet's left edge.  The dark markings represent areas where the reddish tinged dust characteristic of the surface has been blown away by the Martian winds.",
