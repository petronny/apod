  "explanation": "This is what a spiral galaxy looks like sideways.\r This view of NGC 3628 nearly resembles our own Milky Way Galaxy,\r which is also known to be a spiral.\r The dark band across the center is absorbed starlight caused\r by the galaxy's own interstellar dust.\r NGC 3628 is the faintest member of the Leo Triplet,\r a group of galaxies dominated by M65\r and M66. The Leo Triplet\r lies about 35 million light years distant. The center of NGC 3628 emits variable X-ray radiation\r perhaps indicating the presence of a massive black hole.\r",
