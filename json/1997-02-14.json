  "explanation": "Globular clusters\r once ruled the Milky Way. Back in\r the old days, back when our Galaxy\r first formed, perhaps thousands of globular clusters roamed our\r Galaxy. Today, there are perhaps 200 left.\r Many globular clusters were destroyed\r over the eons by repeated fateful encounters with each other or\r the Galactic center. Surviving relics\r are older than any earth fossil,\r older than any other structures in our Galaxy,\r and limit the universe itself\r in raw age. There are few, if any, young globular clusters\r in our Milky Way Galaxy because conditions\r are not ripe for more to form. But things are different next\r door - in the neighboring LMC galaxy.\r Pictured above is a \"young\" globular cluster residing\r there: NGC 1818.\r Recent observations show it formed only about 40 million years\r ago - just yesterday compared to the 12 billion year ages of globular clusters in our own Milky Way",
