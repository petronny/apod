  "explanation": "Something big exploded but astronomers have\r no idea what. On September 24th, the Burst and Transient Source Experiment\r (BATSE) onboard the orbiting Compton Gamma Ray Observatory\r recorded the most intense gamma ray burst\r in its five year history. During its mission, BATSE\r has recorded many gamma ray bursts\r - about one per day, but none were this powerful. Since their\r discovery over 25 years ago,\r the origin and even distance to gamma ray bursts\r remains hotly debated. Bursts are surely mysterious phenomena:\r they flash into existence suddenly dominating the entire gamma-ray sky,\r then typically fade in a few seconds never to be seen again.\r It is possible that this intense wave of gamma radiation\r caused other satellites to glitch and may even have been the cause\r of unusual noise in the Earth's atmosphere. If you know of such\r an anomaly, please report it.\r",
