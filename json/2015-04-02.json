  "explanation": "The Owl and the Galaxy sail these skies With blue and yellow star. They go together beneath the Big Dipper, If you wonder where they are.  The Galaxy's light shines through the night, Ten millions of light-years away. But never fear the Owl is near, Inside the Milky Way. A cosmic shroud, the Owl is proud, its central star a must. And the spiral Galaxy lies on edge To show off all its dust, Its dust, Its dust, To show off all its dust.",
