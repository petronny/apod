  "explanation": "You no longer have to wake-up early to see Comet Hale-Bopp.\r From many northern locations, you can now go outside just after\r sunset and see Comet Hale-Bopp above the north-western horizon.\r Both writer/editors of APOD are\r impressed by how bright Comet Hale-Bopp\r has become, and how easily visible it is. The central coma is\r now visible\r from almost any location - even from a bright city. The blue\r ion tale is visible from a dark location. Comet Hale-Bopp's\r coma now rivals even last\r year's Comet Hyakutake, and\r the tail appears to be increasing\r in length daily. \r",
