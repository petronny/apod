  "explanation": "Planets condense from disks. Several new Hubble Space Telescope pictures of stars surrounded by disks were released earlier this week.  Since the glare of the central star usually makes a surrounding disk hard to see, prior observations in radio and infrared light were used to isolate systems where the disk was edge-on, blocking much of the central starlight.  One such disk system, Haro 6-5B, is shown above in false color. Here, the central disk confines the emitted light into an hourglass shape.  Complex dust clouds appear dark.  A powerful protruding jet is shown in green.  This budding planetary system measures 0.2 light-years across.  Quite possibly, our own Solar System looked like this about 5 billion years ago.",
