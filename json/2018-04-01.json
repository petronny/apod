  "explanation": "I love you so much that I brought you the Moon.  Please take it before this tree becomes more interested.  Also the Moon is heavier than I thought.  And I foolishly picked it up by the hot side by mistake.  But it is for you and, well, the others reading this APOD.  Promise to keep this image -- our image -- in a safe place, and know that it was taken in a single, well-planned exposure in Valladolid, Spain.  Please take it and keep it always as a token of our love and, well, April Fool's Day.   Retrospective: April Fool's Day APODs",
