The Endeavor and ISS crew installed Italy's Raffaello, a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module and successfully deployed Canada's Canadarm2, a robot remote-controlled arm that can move about the outside of the station. The shuttle undocked from the ISS yesterday and is scheduled to return to Earth today.  A manned Russian Soyuz spacecraft is scheduled to dock with Earth's busiest orbiting outpost early today.",
