Captured on August 26, 28, and September 1 (left to right) the storm approximately doubles in length during that period. Stretching along the jetstream of the planet's North Temperate Belt it travels eastward in successive frames, passing the Great Red Spot and whitish Oval BA, famous storms in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Galilean moons Callisto and Io are caught in the middle frame. In fact, telescopic skygazers following Jupiter in planet Earth's night have reported dramatic fast moving storm outbreaks over the past few weeks in Jupiter's North Temperate Belt.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2009/Jupiters1_swimmingstormsACasely.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter's Swimming Storm","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2009/Jupiters1_swimmingstormsACasely1024.jpg"}
