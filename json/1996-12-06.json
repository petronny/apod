  "explanation": "This huge ball of stars predates our Sun.\r Long before mankind evolved, before dinosaurs roamed,\r and even before our Earth existed, ancient globs of stars condensed\r and orbited a young Milky Way Galaxy.\r Of the 250\r or so globular clusters\r that survive today, M3\r is one of the largest and brightest, easily visible\r in the Northern hemisphere with binoculars. M3\r contains about half a million stars, most of which are old and\r red. The existence of young blue stars in M3 once posed a mystery,\r but these blue stragglers are now thought to form via stellar interactions.\r",
