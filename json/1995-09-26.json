  "explanation": "As the Earth spins on its axis, the sky seems to rotate around us.  This motion produces the beautiful concentric arcs traced out by the stars in this time exposure of the night sky.  In the foreground of the picture is the dome of the Anglo-Australian Telescope in central New South Wales Australia.  In the middle of the picture is the South Celestial Pole, easily identified as the point in the sky at the center of all the star trail arcs.",
