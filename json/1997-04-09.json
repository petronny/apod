  "explanation": "Is there life beneath Europa? Today, new\r results are being announced\r (at about 2 pm EST) about the possibility of oceans\r under Jupiter's\r moon Europa.\r The existence of such oceans increases the likelihood that some\r sort of life exists beneath the fractured ice planes\r of Jupiter's smoothest satellite.\r Results from the February 20th flyby\r of the robot spacecraft Galileo\r past Europa\r now clearly indicate that either large bodies of water or slush\r exist under a relatively thin ice sheet covering the moon's surface,\r at least in some regions. Areas on the surface are marked by\r very few craters, indicating that water flowed there in the time\r since most craters formed.  \r",
