  "explanation": "Our Sun has spots!\r These spots appear dark in photographs like the one above, but in fact sunspots are quite bright - they are just dark compared\r to the rest of the Sun. Sunspots\r are about the size of the Earth and\r frequently occur in groups, as shown above. Sunspots\r occur when a concentrated portion of the Solar magnetic field\r pokes through the surface. This field slows energy from entering\r the sunspot\r region, causing sunspots to appear cooler, darker, and lower than\r the surrounding surface. Sunspots\r typically last about a month or two before dissipating. The number\r of sunspots\r is always changing, generally going from a maximum to a minimum about every 5 \u00bd years.\r In fact, the Sun\r just passed a minimum last year. The Sun and sunspots should never be looked at directly.\r",
