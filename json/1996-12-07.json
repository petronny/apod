  "explanation": "How do planets form? Astronomers are finding\r out by studying one of the most interesting of all astronomical\r nebulae known, the Great Nebula in Orion.\r Insets to above mosaic\r show several planetary systems in\r formation. The bottom left insert shows the relative size of\r our own Solar System. The Orion Nebula\r contains many stellar nurseries. These nurseries contain hydrogen\r gas, hot young stars, proplyds, and\r stellar jets spewing material at\r high speeds. Much of the filamentary structure visible in this\r image are actually shock waves\r - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas.\r Some shock waves are visible near one of the bright stars in the\r lower left of the picture. The Orion Nebula\r is located in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy\r as is our Sun.\r",
