  "explanation": "A flying saucer from outer space crash-landed in the Utah desert in 2004 after being tracked by radar and chased by helicopters.  No space aliens were involved, however.  The saucer, pictured above, was the Genesis sample return capsule, part of a human-made robot Genesis spaceship launched in 2001 by NASA itself to study the Sun.  The unexpectedly hard landing at over 300 kilometers per hour occurred because the parachutes did not open as planned.  The Genesis mission had been orbiting the Sun collecting solar wind particles that are usually deflected away by Earth's magnetic field. Despite the crash landing, many return samples remained in good enough condition to analyze and research is ongoing.  So far, discoveries include new details about the composition of the Sun and the effects of the solar wind on unprotected material.",
