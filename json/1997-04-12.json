  "explanation": "The Arecibo radio telescope\r is currently the largest single-dish telescope in the world. First\r opening in 1963, this 305 meter (1000 foot) radio telescope resides\r in a natural valley of Puerto Rico.\r The Arecibo telescope\r has been used for many astronomical research projects,\r including searches and studies of pulsars,\r and mapping atomic and molecular gas\r in the Galaxy and the universe.\r As the Arecibo dish can also be used to send radio waves, it has\r bounced and recorded radiation off of planets in our Solar System,\r and has even broadcast messages\r to areas of the Galaxy that might contain intelligent extra-terrestrial life.\r Any person in the world may use the telescope, providing their\r proposal\r is selected by a review committee.\r",
