  "explanation": "Have you contemplated your sky recently?  Last night was a good one for midnight meditators at many northerly locations as meteors from the Perseid meteor shower frequently streaked through.  The Perseid meteor shower has slowly been building to a crescendo but should continue to be rewarding tonight and into the week.  Pictured above on August 1, a group of celestial sightseers near Quebec, Canada are treated to a dark and wondrous night sky that contained bright stars, green auroras, the band of our Milky Way galaxy, a majestic Moon rising, the International Space Station slowly gliding by, and the occasional flash of a Perseid meteor.  Although no meteors were caught in this frame, the Big Dipper remained quite prominent.",
