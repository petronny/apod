Taken on March 14, this night skyscape was made by combining 230 exposures each 15 seconds long to follow the stars' circular paths. The camera was fixed to a tripod on an isolated terrace near the center of Ragusa, Italy, on the island of Sicily. But the night sky was shared around the rotating planet. A friend to celestial navigators and astrophotographers alike Polaris, the north star, makes the short bright trail near the center of the concentric celestial arcs.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/STARTRAILRAGUSA14_03_2020_14mm3120px.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Stars Trail over Ragusa","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/STARTRAILRAGUSA14_03_2020_14mm1024px.jpg"}
