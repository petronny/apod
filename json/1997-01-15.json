  "explanation": "What does a black hole look like? If alone,\r a black hole\r would indeed appear\r quite black, but many black hole candidates are part of binary star systems.\r So how does a black hole binary system\r look different from a neutron star binary system?\r The above drawings indicate it\r is difficult to tell! Recent theoretical work,\r however, has provided a new way to tell them apart: advective accretion flows (ADAFs).\r A black hole system so equipped\r would appear much darker than a similar neutron star\r system. The difference is caused by the hot gas from the ADAF disk\r falling through the event horizon\r of the black hole and disappearing - gas that would have emitted\r much light were the central object only a neutron star. Recent observations\r of the soft X-ray transient\r V404 Cyg\r has yielded a spectrum\r much like an ADAF onto a black hole\r - and perhaps brighter than allowable from an ADAF onto a neutron\r star. \r",
