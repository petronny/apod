{"date":"2020-08-28","explanation":"This exciting and unfamiliar view of the Orion Nebula is a visualization based on astronomical data and movie rendering techniques. Up close and personal with a famous stellar nursery normally seen from 1,500 light-years away, the digitally modeled frame transitions from a visible light representation based on Hubble data on the left to infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope on the right. The perspective at the center looks along a valley over a light-year wide, in the wall of the region's giant molecular cloud. Orion's valley ends in a cavity carved by the energetic winds and radiation of the massive central stars of the Trapezium star cluster. The single frame is part of a multiwavelength, three-dimensional video that lets the viewer experience an immersive, three minute flight through the Great Nebula of Orion.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2008/PIA22089OrionValley.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Valley of Orion","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2008/PIA22089OrionValley.jpg"}
