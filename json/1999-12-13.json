  "explanation": "Stars of many types and colors are visible in this Hubble Space Telescope vista of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Over 10,000 stars are visible -- the brightest of which are giant stars.  Were our Sun 170,000 light-years distant and among these stars, it would hardly be discernable.  By contrast, only a few thousand stars are individually visible at night with the unaided eye, and many of these lie within only a few hundred light-years.  Typically, the light we see from nearby stars left during the age of our great-grand-parents, while light from LMC stars started its journey before the dawn of recorded human history.",
