  "explanation": "Stars of many types and colors are visible in this Hubble Space Telescope close-up of a starfield in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Over 10,000 stars are visible -- the brightest of which are giant stars.  Were our Sun at the distance of these stars, about 170,000 light-years, it would hardly be discernable.  By contrast, only a few thousand individual stars can be seen in the night sky with the unaided eye, and many of these lie within only a few hundred light-years.  So typically, the light we see from nearby stars left during the age of our great-grand-parents, while light from LMC stars started its journey well before the dawn of recorded human history.",
