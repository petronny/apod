  "explanation": "What happens when a star runs out of nuclear fuel? The center condenses into a white dwarf while the outer atmospheric layers are expelled into space and appear as a planetary nebula. This particular planetary nebula, designated Shapley 1 after the famous astronomer Harlow Shapley, has a very apparent annular ring like structure.  Although some of these nebulae appear like planets on the sky (hence their name), they actually surround stars far outside our Solar System.",
