  "explanation": "This strange structure is what can result when a normal star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core.  At that time,  the center condenses into a white dwarf while the outer atmospheric layers are expelled into space and appear as a planetary nebula. This particular planetary nebula, designated Shapley 1 after the famous astronomer Harlow Shapley, has a very apparent annular ring like structure.  Although some of these nebula appear like planets on the sky (hence their name), they actually surround stars far outside our solar system.",
