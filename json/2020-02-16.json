{"date":"2020-02-16","explanation":"To some, this huge nebula resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood.  In 1787, astronomer William Herschel discovered this unusual planetary nebula:  NGC 2392.  More recently, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the nebula in visible light, while the nebula was also imaged in X-rays by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The featured combined visible-X ray image, shows X-rays emitted by central hot gas in pink. The nebula displays gas clouds so complex they are not fully understood.  NGC 2392 is a double-shelled planetary nebula, with the more distant gas having composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star only 10,000 years ago.  The outer shell contains unusual light-year long orange filaments. The inner filaments visible are being ejected by strong wind of particles from the central star.  The NGC 2392 Nebula spans about 1/3 of a light year and lies in our Milky Way Galaxy, about 3,000 light years distant, toward the constellation of the Twins (Gemini).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2002/NGC2392_HubbleSchmidt_960.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 2392: Double-Shelled Planetary Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2002/NGC2392_HubbleSchmidt_960.jpg"}
