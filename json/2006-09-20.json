  "explanation": "The developing International Space Station (ISS) has changed its appearance again.  Over the past few days, the Space Shuttle Atlantis visited the ISS and added pieces of the  Integrated Truss Structure, including an impressively long array of solar panels.  These expansive solar panels are visible extending from the lower right of the above image taken by the Shuttle Atlantis Crew after leaving the ISS to return to Earth. The world's foremost space outpost can be seen developing over the past several years by comparing the above image to past images.  Also visible above are many different types of modules, a robotic arm, another impressive set of  solar panels, and a supply ship.  Construction began on the ISS in 1998.",
