  "explanation": "The first APOD appeared eight years ago today, on 1995 June 16.  To date, we estimate that APOD has now served over 100 million space-related images.  We again thank our readers and NASA for their continued support, but ask that any potentially congratulatory e-mail go to the folks who created the great pictures -- many times with considerable effort -- that APOD has been fortunate enough to feature over the past year.  Many can be contacted by following links found in the credit line under the image.  Some of these images are featured in the above spectacular collage submitted by an enthusiastic APOD reader well skilled in digital image manipulation.  She challenges fellow APODees to find in the collage her favorite ex-member of the musical group Tangerine Dream.",
