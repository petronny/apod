  "explanation": "very bright object in this 1994 photograph by the Hubble Space Telescope is a galaxy. Oddly - most of the objects are  spiral galaxies. This rich cluster of galaxies, named CL 0939+4713, is almost half way across the visible universe. Photos like this indicate that clusters in the past contained a higher fraction of spirals than do nearby clusters, which are usually dominated by elliptical galaxies.",
