In the town of Salamanca, Spain, the photographer noticed how distinctive a grove of oak trees looked after being pruned.  Next came the galaxy. The photographer stayed up until 2 am, waiting until the Milky Way Galaxy rose above the level of a majestic looking oak.  From this carefully chosen perspective, dust lanes in the galaxy appear to be natural continuations to branches of the tree.  Last came the light. A flashlight was used on the far side of the tree to project a silhouette. By coincidence, other trees also appeared as similar silhouettes across the relatively bright horizon. The featured image was captured as a single 30-second frame in 2015 and processed to digitally enhance the Milky Way.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/MWTree_Toledano_6016.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Galaxy Tree","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/MWTree_Toledano_1080.jpg"}
