  "explanation": "Using the new camera on the recently refitted Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have been able to confirm that the Moon is made of green cheese.  The telling clue was the resolution of a numeric date after which the Moon may go bad.  Controversy still exists, however, over whether the date resolved is truly an expiration date or just a \"sell by\" date.  \"To be cautious, we should completely devour the Moon by tomorrow,\" a spokesperson advised.  Happy April Fool's Day from the folks at APOD.  The above image (slightly altered) was actually taken in 1965 by the Ranger 9 probe minutes before impact.  The popular \"Moon is made of Green Cheese\" myth can be traced back almost 500 years.  It has been used historically in context to indicate a claim so clearly false that no one -- not even April Fools -- will believe it.",
