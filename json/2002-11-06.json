  "explanation": "Some of the brightest stars form a large and easily found pattern in the winter sky of Earth's northern hemisphere.  Dubbed the  Winter Hexagon, the stars involved can usually be identified even in the bright night skies of a big city.  The six stars that compose the Winter Hexagon are Aldebaren, Capella, Castor, Procyon, Rigel, and Sirius.  Rolling your cursor over the above image will identify them.  The Winter Hexagon asterism engulfs several constellations including Orion and Canis Major.",
