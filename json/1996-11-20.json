  "explanation": "What mysteries might be solved by peering\r into this crystal ball? This crystal ball is quite unusual because\r it is actually a moon of Jupiter,\r the crystals are ice-crystals, and the ball is not only dirty\r and opaque but cracked beyond repair. Nevertheless, speculation\r is rampant that oceans exist under these tortured ice-plains\r that could support life. Europa,\r the smallest of Jupiter's Galilean moons,\r was photographed last month in natural color by the robot spacecraft Galileo,\r now in orbit around Jupiter.\r The brown patches are what one might think: dirt -- tainting\r an otherwise white ice-crust.  Europa,\r nearly the same size as Earth's Moon,\r similarly keeps one face toward its home planet. The hemisphere\r of Europa\r shown above is the one that always trails. Why is Europa's\r surface the smoothest in the Solar System?\r Where are Europa's craters?\r",
