{"copyright":"Tiziano Boldrini","date":"2020-05-09","explanation":"Rising as the Sun set, the Moon was bright and full in planet Earth skies on May 7 and known to some as a Flower Moon. Near the horizon it does seem to take on rose pink hues of reddened sunlight in this reflective twilight scene. In fact one of the brighter Full Moons of the year, this month's full lunar phase occurred within about 32 hours of perigee. That's the closest point in the Moon's elliptical orbit. Flooded field and ruined church tower are near the municipality of Casaleggio Novara, Piedmont Region of northern Italy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2005/FullFlowerMoonrise_Boldrini.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Full Flower Moonrise","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2005/FullFlowerMoonrise_Boldrini.jpg"}
