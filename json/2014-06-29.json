  "explanation": "To see a vista like this takes patience, hiking, and a camera. Patience was needed in searching out just the right place and waiting for just the right time.  A short hike was needed to reach this rugged perch above a secluded cove in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park in California, USA. And a camera was needed for the long exposure required to bring out the faint light from stars and nebulae in the background Milky Way galaxy. Moonlight  illuminated the hidden beach and inlet behind nearby trees in the above composite image taken last month. Usually obscured McWay Falls is visible just below the image center, while the Pacific Ocean is in view to its right.  The above image is a high-resolution sequel to a similar image that appeared last year.",
