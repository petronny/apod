  "explanation": "The above computer animated picture\r depicts how a very compact star\r would look to a nearby observer. The star pictured\r is actually more compact that any known except a black hole,\r so it is only hypothetical. The observer is situated at the photon sphere,\r where photons can orbit in a circle. To help the viewer better\r visualize the great distortions created by gravity, a map of the\r Earth was projected onto the star,\r and a map of the familiar night sky was projected above. From\r here one can either look down and see several duplicate images\r of the entire surface of the star, look up and see several duplicate\r images of the entire night sky, or look along the photon sphere\r and see the back of one's own head. \r",
