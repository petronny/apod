The featured wide-angle mosaic was taken over the steppe golden fields in M\u00e9rtola, Portugal in 2020. From such a dark location, an immediately-evident breathtaking glow arched over the night sky: the central band of our Milky Way galaxy.  But this sky had much more. Thin clouds crossed the sky like golden ribbons.
