  "explanation": "Last night and tonight, a lucky few may see a meteor explode.  As our Earth passes unusually close to debris expelled from Comet Tempel-Tuttle, many sand-sized particles from this comet are entering and burning up in the Earth's atmosphere.  This yearly phenomenon is known as the Leonids Meteor Shower, but the location the Earth passes through this year holds promise to provide relatively high activity.  In particular, the 1998 Leonids was noteworthy for its many bright meteors.  In the above slow-loading sequence, a 1998 Leonid was caught exploding over Los Alamos, New Mexico.  In the last one-minute exposure, another Leonid streaks past.",
