  "explanation": "ven the hot and cracked surface of Venus has rolling hills.  Although never actually photographed from up-close, images of the Venusian surface like that shown above have been constructed in recent years by digitally merging distant photographs from height-sensitive radar.  Isolated above is a 100-kilometer wide swath inside a volcanic region known as Yavine Corona.  Visible in the frame are numerous fractures in the surface.  Data is missing from the dark lane on the upper right.  The surface of Venus is so hot and oppressive that robot spacecraft landed there have lasted for only a few hours.",
