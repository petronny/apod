Of course, the colorful concentric arcs traced out by the stars are really centered on the planet's North Celestial Pole. Convenient for northern hemisphere astro-imagers and celestial navigators alike, bright star Polaris is near the pole and positioned in this scene to be behind the telescope dome. Made with a camera fixed to a tripod, the series of over 200 stacked digital exposures spanned about 4 hours. The observatory was not operating on that clear, dark night, but that's not surprising. The dome houses the Teide Observatory's large THEMIS Solar Telescope.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1901/Startrail_Funes.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Circumpolar Star Trails","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1901/Startrail_Funes1024.jpg"}
