Rising above the tree-lined slope are familiar stars in planet Earth's northern night and the constellation Orion the Hunter.  Brighter stars marking the celestial Hunter's shoulder (Betelgeuse), foot (Rigel), belt, and sword are clearly reflected in the calm waters from northern Latvia's Vitrupe river. Of course, winter is coming to planet Earth's northern hemisphere.   By then Orion and this beautiful starry vista will be seen rising in early evening skies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1911/orion_kopa.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Orion Rising","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1911/orion_kopa1024.jpg"}
