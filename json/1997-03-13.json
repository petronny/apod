  "explanation": "The Great Comet of 1997\r is now brighter than the Great Comet of 1996\r ever was. In fact, it is brighter than almost every star in the\r sky. Yet Comet Hale-Bopp\r is still about two weeks away from maximum light.\r Comet Hale-Bopp is now well north of the plane of the Earth's\r orbit and on the same side of the sky as the Sun.\r Therefore, Comet Hale-Bopp is visible\r from Earth's Northern Hemisphere\r both just after sunset and just before sunrise. The above picture\r of Comet Hale-Bopp\r was taken last week in Italy. Many Milky Way stars\r and nebulae are visible. To the left is a rock face partly illuminated\r by artificial light.",
