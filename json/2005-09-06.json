  "explanation": "The tiger stripes on Saturn's moon Enceladus might be active.  Even today, they may be spewing ice from the moon's icy interior into space, creating a cloud of fine ice particles over the moon's South Pole and creating Saturn's mysterious E-ring.  Recent evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn.  Cassini detected a marked increase in particle collisions during its July flyby only 270 kilometers over a South Polar region of Enceladus.  Pictured above, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown from the close flyby.  The unusual surface features dubbed tiger stripes are visible on the left in false-color blue.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead.",
