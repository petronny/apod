  "explanation": "We live in a forest.  Strewn throughout the universe are \"trees\" of hydrogen gas that absorb light from distant objects.  These gas clouds leave numerous absorption lines in a distant quasar's spectra, together called the Lyman-alpha forest.  Distant quasars appear to be absorbed by many more Lyman-alpha clouds than nearby quasars, indicating a Lyman-alpha thicket early in our universe.  The above image depicts one possible computer realization of how Lyman-alpha clouds were distributed at a redshift of 3.  Each side of the box measures 30 million light-years across.  Much remains unknown about the Lyman-alpha forest, including the real geometry and extent of the clouds, and why there are so many fewer clouds today.",
