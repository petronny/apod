  "explanation": "Comet Hale-Bopp\r continues its slow trek across the night sky, and can now be seen\r superposed near the bright globular cluster M14.\r Will Comet Hale-Bopp\r become as bright in early 1997 as Comet Hyakutake\r did in early 1996? It is still too early to tell. Currently\r Hale-Bopp\r is curiously holding at about 5th magnitude\r - just barely bright enough to see\r without binoculars from a dark location. Because of the size\r of coma, some speculate\r that the nucleus of Hale-Bopp\r is unusually large. The actual nucleus is obscured, however,\r and recent speculation\r includes that the nucleus is comparable in size to Comet Halley\r - about 10-15 km across.\r",
