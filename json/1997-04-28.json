  "explanation": "Io has its own cloud.  Jupiter's most active moon is visible on the left of the above false-color photograph, with its left side illuminated by sunlight.  But what is happening on Io's right side?  Here a plume of gas from the active volcano Prometheus also reflects sunlight.  A second active volcano, Pele, is also visible: marked by the red spot just below Io's center. Surrounding the moon is a yellow haze originating from gas ejected by Io's volcanos.  Sodium atoms in the gas cloud are particulary efficient at reflecting yellow light.  Several points of light are background stars.",
