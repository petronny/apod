  "explanation": "The Earth glows in many kinds of light, including\r the energetic X-ray band.\r Actually, the Earth itself does\r not glow - only aurora produced high\r in the Earth's atmosphere.\r Above is the first picture of the Earth in X-rays,\r taken in March with the orbiting Polar satellite.\r Bright X-ray emission\r is shown in red. Energetic ions from the Sun\r cause aurora\r and energize electrons\r in the Earth's magnetosphere.\r These electrons move along the Earth's magnetic field\r and eventually strike the Earth's ionosphere,\r causing the X-ray emission. These X-rays are not dangerous because\r they are absorbed by lower parts of the Earth's atmosphere.",
