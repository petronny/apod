  "explanation": "What's the best way to the city center?  What looks like a street map of some city on Earth is actually a series of naturally-formed fragmented polar polygons on Mars.  The existence of polar polygons on Mars is particularly interesting as they may indicate regions where water ice lies within a few meters of the surface.  Similar looking polygons are commonly found in the arctic and Antarctic of Earth, where they typically form from a repetitive cycle of freezing and thawing.  The above image spans a distance of about 3 kilometers and was taken recently by the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor.",
