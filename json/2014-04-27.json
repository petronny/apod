  "explanation": "A spacesuit floated away from the International Space Station eight years ago, but no investigation was conducted.  Everyone knew that it was pushed by the space station crew.   Dubbed Suitsat-1, the unneeded Russian Orlan spacesuit filled mostly with old clothes was fitted with a faint radio transmitter and released to orbit the Earth. The suit circled the Earth twice before its radio signal became unexpectedly weak. Suitsat-1 continued to orbit every 90 minutes until it burned up in the Earth's atmosphere after a few weeks.  Pictured above, the lifeless spacesuit was photographed in 2006 just as it drifted away from  space station.    Follow APOD on: Facebook,  Google Plus, or Twitter",
