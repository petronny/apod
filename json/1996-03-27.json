  "explanation": "The above true-color photo taken March 25th shows Comet Hyakutake passing below the stars of the Big Dipper.  Many astronomy enthusiasts delight in helping people in their local community see the comet. Both Jerry Bonnell and I (RJN) from APOD have been so inclined - both now and when Comet Halley came by in 1986. During these sessions, many good questions are asked and occasionally a humorous situation will arise. One was with a little girl. She waited so patiently for her turn to look through the telescope, hardly able to contain her excitement. Finally her turn came. \"Do you see the comet?\" I asked. \"Wow, wow, WOW!\" She beamed. \"You see it?\" \"No.\" One little boy seemed particularly bent on destruction. \"This telescope looks like a big gun,\" he volunteered. \"In some ways, it's even more powerful than a gun,\" I replied, hoping to challenge his imagination. \"Really?\" he countered. \"Can we shoot down the comet?\" \"How expensive is the telescope?\" is a fairly common question. But one time a real business-person showed up and, possibly feeling particularly affluent, asked \"How much is the comet?\"  Latest Comet Hyakutake images: JPL, Crni Vrh Observatory, Slovenia, Fayetteville Observer-Times, NASA's Night of the Comet",
