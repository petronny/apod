  "explanation": "Jupiter has rings, too. Unlike Saturn's bright rings\r which are composed of chunks of ice, Jupiter's rings\r are darker and appear to consist of fine particles of rock. The\r six pictures above\r were taken in infrared light from the Infrared Telescope Facility\r in Hawaii in 1994, and cover a time\r span of two hours. Quite visible are Jupiter's rings, bands and spots\r in the outer atmosphere. Also visible\r in the photos, however, are two small Jovian moons. Metis,\r only 40 kilometers across, appears in the second picture as a\r dim spot on the rings to the right of Jupiter. Amalthea,\r much larger and brighter, appears in the third frame on the far left, and can\r be seen to pass across the face of Jupiter\r in frames four and five. The origin of Jupiter's rings remains unknown,\r although hypothesized to be created by material scattered from\r meteorite impacts onto Jupiter's moons.\r",
