  "explanation": "What is that inverted rainbow in the sky?  Sometimes known as a fire rainbow for its flame-like appearance, a circumhorizon arc is created by ice, not fire.   For a circumhorizon arc to be visible, the Sun must be at least 58 degrees high in a sky where cirrus clouds are present.  Furthermore, the numerous, flat, hexagonal ice-crystals that compose the cirrus cloud must be aligned horizontally to properly refract sunlight like a single gigantic prism.  Therefore, circumhorizon arcs are quite unusual to see.  Pictured above, however, a rare fire rainbow was captured above trees in Whiting, New Jersey, USA in late May.",
