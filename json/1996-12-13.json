  "explanation": "Five closely grouped galaxies are visible\r in this image\r made using the Kitt Peak National Observatory\r 2.1 meter telescope. The grouping is commonly known as Stephan's\r Quintet. Four of the galaxies show essentially the same redshift\r suggesting that they are at the same distance from us. The large\r bluish spiral below and left of\r center actually has a smaller redshift\r than the others, indicating it is much closer. It is probably\r a foreground object which happens to lie along the line of sight\r to the more distant galaxies. Of the four distant galaxies,\r three seem to be colliding, showing\r serious distortions due to gravitational tidal forces. The fourth\r is a normal appearing elliptical galaxy\r (at the lower right edge of the field). Recent results suggest\r that collisions play an important role in the life cycles of galaxies.\r",
