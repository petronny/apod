Those familiar stars of the constellation of the Hunter are caught above the trees in this colorful night skyscape. Not a star at all but still visible to eye, the Great Nebula of Orion shines below the Hunter's belt stars. The camera's exposure reveals the stellar nursery's faint pinkish glow. Betelgeuse, giant star at Orion's shoulder, has the color of warm and cozy terrestrial lighting, but so does another familiar stellar giant, Aldebaran. Alpha star of the constellation Taurus the Bull, Aldebaran anchors the recognizable V-shape traced by the Hyades Cluster toward the top of the starry frame.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/WinterSceneBlock.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Northern Winter Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/WinterSceneBlock.jpg"}
