  "explanation": "On some nights the sky is the most interesting show in town.  This picture captures a particularly active and colorful display of aurora that occurred a month ago high above Alaska.  Auroras are more commonly seen by observers located near the Earth's poles.  Aurora light results from solar electrons and protons striking molecules high in the Earth's atmosphere.  Planetary aurora activity can sometimes be predicted after particularly active solar coronal mass ejections.",
