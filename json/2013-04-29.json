  "explanation": "What's that next to the Milky Way? An unusual natural rock formation known as Roque Cinchado or Stone Tree found on the Spanish Canary Island of Tenerife.  A famous icon, Roque Cinchado is likely a dense plug of cooled volcanic magma that remains after softer surrounding rock eroded away.  Majestically, the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy is visible arcing across the right of the above seven image panoramic mosaic taken during the summer of 2010.  On the far right is the Teide volcano complete with a lenticular cloud hovering near its peak. \u00a0   Follow APOD on: Facebook (Daily) (Sky) (Spanish) or Google Plus (Daily) (River) (Portuguese)",
