In the imaginative work of cosmic nature photography a close-up lens was used to image a previously made picture of a galaxy, viewed through a water drop suspended from a stem. A favorite of many telescope-wielding astroimagers, the galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31. About 100,000 light-years across that majestic galaxy's spiral arms and dust lanes are curved and distorted in the image contained in the centimeter-sized droplet. Andromeda is some 2.5 million light-years distant, but this project was still carried out while spending time indoors.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/Galassiainunagoccia.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Little Drop of Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2003/Galassiainunagoccia1024.jpg"}
