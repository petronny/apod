{"copyright":"Jack Fusco","date":"2019-06-08","explanation":"At the end of last year's northern summer, after its dazzling opposition, Mars still shone brightly in the night. The celestial beacon easily attracted the attention of these two night skygazers who stood still for just a while, but long enough to be captured in the sea and night skyscape from Big Sur, planet Earth. Its central bulge near the southwestern horizon, the Milky Way runs through the scene too, while the long exposure also reveals a faint blue bioluminescence blooming in the waves along Pfeiffer Beach. Now much fainter, Mars can be spotted near the western horizon after sunset, but this month Jupiter is near its closest and brightest, reaching its own opposition on June 10. Night skygazers can spot brilliant Jupiter over southern horizons, glaring next to the stars toward the central Milky Way.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/Fusco-BigSurKonaMWBioluminescenceMars-exif.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"On the Beach with Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/Fusco-BigSurKonaMWBioluminescenceMars-exif1024.jpg"}
