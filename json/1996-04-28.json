  "explanation": "Comet Hyakutake is seen here just as the Sun sets on April 22. As April draws to a close, Comet Hyakutake will be visible only just after sunset and will be hard to discern against the brightly lit sky. Unfortunately, Comet Hyakutake did not brighten as much as hoped during its journey to the inner Solar System, and is now not supposed to get as bright as it did when it passed the Earth in late March. Nevertheless, Comet Hyakutake is still a bright comet and spectacular sight.
