  "explanation": "This past weekend Comet McNaught peaked at a brightness that surpassed even Venus.  Fascinated sky enthusiasts in the Earth's northern hemisphere were treated to an instantly visible comet head and a faint elongated tail near sunrise and sunset.  Recent brightness estimates had Comet McNaught brighter than magnitude -5 (minus five) over this past weekend, making it the brightest comet since Comet Ikeya-Seki in 1965, which was recorded at -7 (minus seven). The Great Comet of 2007 reached its brightest as it rounded the Sun well inside the orbit of Mercury. Over the next week Comet McNaught will begin to fade as it moves south and away from the Sun.  The unexpectedly bright comet should remain visible to observers in the southern hemisphere with unaided eyes for the rest of January.  The above image, vertically compressed, was taken at sunset last Friday from mountains above Catalonia, Spain.",
