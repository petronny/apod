  "explanation": "Comet Hale-Bopp continues to look impressive.\r The photograph above\r captured the comet on April 7th passing nearly in front\r of M34,\r a star cluster in the constellation of Perseus.\r Many of the stars in this open cluster\r can be seen through Comet Hale-Bopp's\r white dust tail. The bright blue ion tail\r now shows several streams. Now receding\r from both the Sun and the Earth, Comet Hale-Bopp\r should still remain an impressive sight\r for weeks to come as it slowly fades.\r",
