  "explanation": "Ni\u00f1o is a temporary global climate change resulting from unusually warm water in the central Pacific Ocean.  El Ni\u00f1o can cause unusual or severe weather for some locations over the next few months. Warm water is shown in white in the above false-color picture taken by the orbiting TOPEX/Poseidon satellite in late October.  The Pacific Ocean is color coded by sea surface height relative to normal ocean levels. The large white area represents a mass of warm water 30 times greater than all the Great Lakes, flowing toward the Americas. Although El Ni\u00f1os occur every decade or so, this year's is the first ever predicted. The cause and full effects of El Ni\u00f1os are still under study.",
