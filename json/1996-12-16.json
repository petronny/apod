  "explanation": "Old photographs show no evidence of the above\r nebula. In 1992, a white dwarf star in Cygnus\r blew off its outer layers in a classical nova explosion:\r an event called Nova Cygni 1992.\r Light flooded the local interstellar neighborhood, illuminated\r this existing gas cloud,\r excited the existing hydrogen,\r and hence caused the red emission. The only gas actually expelled\r by the nova\r can be seen as a small red ball just above the photograph's center.\r Eventually, light from the nova shell\r will fade, and this nebula will again become invisible! \r",
