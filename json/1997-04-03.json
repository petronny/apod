  "explanation": "Does a comet's dust tail always orbit behind\r it? Since comets rotate, they shed gas and dust\r in all directions equally. Small ice and dust\r particles expelled by the comet, however, are literally pushed\r around by sunlight. The smaller the particle, the greater the\r effect. When the comet\r is headed inward, sunlight slows down small particles so they\r orbit behind the comet. When the comet is headed back out\r though, sunlight speeds them up, so small particles orbit in front\r of the comet. Comet Hale-Bopp\r itself is too big to have its orbit affected by the momentum of\r sunlight. Therefore, since Comet Hale-Bopp\r started back out to the outer Solar System two days ago, we can\r expect the dramatic dust tail shown above\r to shift in front in the coming days.",
