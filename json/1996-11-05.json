  "explanation": "Almost every object in the above photograph\r is a galaxy. The Coma Cluster of Galaxies\r pictured is one of the densest clusters\r known - it contains thousands of galaxies.\r Each of these galaxies house billions of stars - just like our\r own Milky Way Galaxy. Although nearby\r when compared to most other clusters, light from the Coma Cluster\r still takes hundreds of millions of years to reach us. In fact,\r the Coma Cluster\r is so big it takes light millions of years just to go from one\r side to the other!  Most galaxies in Coma and other clusters\r are ellipticals, while most galaxies\r outside of clusters are spirals.\r The nature of Coma's X-ray emission\r is still being investigated.\r",
