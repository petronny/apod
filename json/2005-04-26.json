  "explanation": "What goes there across the plains of Mars?  A dust devil.  For the first time, definitive movies of the famous spinning dust towers have been created from ground level.  The robot rover Spirit has now imaged several dust devils from its hillside perch just within the past two months.  Each image in the above sequence was taken about 20 seconds apart.  Inspection of the digitally resized images show the passing dust devil raising Martian dust so thick that it casts a shadow.  The new dust devil movies have been made possible by a new hybrid interaction system where the robot Spirit on Mars takes many images and humans on Earth inspect thumbnails and decide which full resolution images to send back.",
