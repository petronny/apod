  "explanation": "Humans once walked on the Moon. Pictured\r above is the second person to stand on the lunar surface: Edwin\r \"Buzz\" Aldrin. During this Apollo 11\r mission, Neil Armstrong\r (the first person to walk on the moon) and Buzz Aldrin\r landed on the Moon while Michael Collins\r circled in the Command Module\r above. The lunar team\r erected a plaque on the surface that reads: HERE MEN FROM THE\r PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON JULY 1969 A.D. WE CAME\r IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. The Apollo missions demonstrated that\r it is possible to land humans on the Moon\r and return them safely.\r",
