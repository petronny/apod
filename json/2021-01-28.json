{"date":"2021-01-28","explanation":"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy Messier 66 lies a mere 35 million light-years away. The gorgeous island universe is about 100 thousand light-years across, similar in size to the Milky Way. This reprocessed Hubble Space Telescope close-up view spans a region about 30,000 light-years wide around the galactic core. It shows the galaxy's disk dramatically inclined to our line-of-sight. Surrounding its bright core, the likely home of a supermassive black hole, obscuring dust lanes and young, blue star clusters sweep along spiral arms dotted with the tell-tale glow of pinksh star forming regions. Messier 66, also known as NGC 3627, is the brightest of the three galaxies in the gravitationaly interacting Leo Triplet.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2101/M66_Hubble_LeoShatz_Crop.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Messier 66 Close Up","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2101/M66_Hubble_LeoShatz_Crop1024.jpg"}
