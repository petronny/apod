  "explanation": "On July 21, 1969 Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr. lifted off the lunar surface in the ascent stage of their lunar module dubbed \"The Eagle\" -- after becoming the first to walk on the moon. Seen here the Eagle soars towards a rendezvous with the orbiting Command Module piloted by Michael Collins. The smooth, dark mare area on the surface below is Mare Smithii located just below the equator on the extreme eastern edge of the lunar nearside. The Earth is visible hanging above the moon's western horizon.",
