  "explanation": "On June 8, Venus was not the only celestial object to pass in front of the Sun.  A few well-situated photographers caught the International Space Station also crossing the Sun simultaneously.  Pictured above is a unique time-lapse image of the unprecedented double transit, a rare event that was visible for less than a second from a narrow band on Earth.   The above image is a combination of 12 frames taken 0.033 seconds apart and each themselves lasting only 1/10,000 th of a second.  The image was taken from the small village of Stupava in Slovakia.  The next time Venus will appear to cross the Sun from Earth will be in 2012.   News: Today is the 35th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.",
