From high in planet Earth's mesosphere, they reflect sunlight in this predawn skyscape taken on July 8. This summer, the night-shining clouds are not new to the northern high-latitudes. Comet NEOWISE is though. Also known as C/2020 F3, the comet was discovered in March by the Earth-orbiting Near Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) satellite. It's now emerging in morning twilight only just visible to the unaided eye from a clear location above the northeastern horizon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2007/noctilucentNeowisePaoly.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Noctilucent Clouds and Comet NEOWISE","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2007/noctilucentNeowisePaoly600h.jpg"}
