Saturn and Jupiter will remain visible together after sunset for several months.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2008/AlienThrone_Zajac_3807.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter and Saturn Rising Beyond Alien Throne Rock","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2008/AlienThrone_Zajac_960.jpg"}
