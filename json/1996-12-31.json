  "explanation": "Are any volcanoes on Io currently erupting?\r To help answer this, scientists instructed the robot spacecraft Galileo\r to take hourly pictures of this moon\r of Jupiter prior to its most recent\r encounter. The most obvious changes in Io are due to the changing\r amount of sunlight reflected from the moon to the spacecraft.\r More careful inspection does verify continuous volcanic plumes.\r The most prominent plume visible is from Prometheus, visible\r just below Io's\r equator. This plume was first photographed in 1979 by Voyager,\r so Prometheus appears to have been erupting continuously for at\r least 18 years! On most browsers, the above picture will appear\r animated.
