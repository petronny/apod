{"copyright":"Todd Sladoje","date":"2019-05-19","explanation":"Why would clouds appear to be different colors? The reason here is that ice crystals in distant cirrus clouds are acting like little floating prisms.  Sometimes known as a fire rainbow for its flame-like appearance, a circumhorizon arc lies parallel to the horizon. For a circumhorizontal arc to be visible, the Sun must be at least 58 degrees high in a sky where cirrus clouds are present.  Furthermore, the numerous, flat, hexagonal ice-crystals that compose the cirrus cloud must be aligned horizontally to properly refract sunlight in a collectively similar manner.  Therefore, circumhorizontal arcs are quite unusual to see.  This circumhorizon display was photographed through a polarized lens above Dublin, Ohio in 2009.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1905/circumhorizontalarc_sladoje_2304.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Circumhorizontal Arc Over Ohio","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1905/circumhorizontalarc_sladoje_960.jpg"}
