  "explanation": "Does an old, red globular cluster have any\r hot, blue stars? The rightmost picture, taken by the Ultraviolet\r Imaging Telescope in ultraviolet\r light, shows that indeed it does. Pictured,\r Omega Centauri is the largest known\r globular cluster in\r our Galaxy, containing well over\r a million stars. Many of these stars are evident in the visible\r light photograph on the left. When photographed in ultraviolet\r light, however, different and less numerous stars emerge, as evident\r on the photograph on the right. Most of these stars are thought\r to have evolved past the current stage of our Sun.\r These stars no longer fuse hydrogen\r to helium in their core\r but rather fuse\r helium into carbon.\r These stars will soon shed their outer envelopes and end up as\r smoldering carbon embers known as white dwarf\r stars.\r",
