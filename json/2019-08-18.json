We all carry with us trillions of microorganisms as we go through life. These multitudes of bacteria, fungi, and archaea have different DNA than you. Collectively called your microbiome, your shipmates outnumber your own cells. Your crew members form communities, help digest food, engage in battles against intruders, and sometimes commute on a liquid superhighway from one end of your body to the other.  Much of what your microbiome does, however, remains unknown. You are the captain, but being nice to your crew may allow you to explore more of your local cosmos.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1908/HumanSpaceship2_TsevisHubbleRJN_2000.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Human as Spaceship","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1908/HumanSpaceship2_TsevisHubbleRJN_960.jpg"}
