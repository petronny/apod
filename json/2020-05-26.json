Although the Himalayan Mountains are the tallest on planet Earth, they don't measure up to the Milky Way. Visible above the snow-capped mountains in the featured image is the arcing central band of our home galaxy.

Over much of planet Earth, the planets Mercury (faint) and Venus (bright) will be visible this week after sunset.
