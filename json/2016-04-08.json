  "explanation": "rly spring in the northern hemisphere is good season for aurora hunters. Near an equinox Earth's magnetic field is oriented to favor interactions with the solar wind that trigger the alluring glow of the northern lights. On March 28/29 the skies over Kaunisp\u00e4\u00e4 Hill, Lapland, Finland did not disappoint.
