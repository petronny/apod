  "explanation": "This Martian vista is only part of one of the  greatest panoramic views of Mars that has ever been attempted.   The expansive mosaic is helping to keep the robotic Spirit rover busy over the energy draining winter in the southern hemisphere of Mars.  During the winter, Spirit is constrained to stay on the side of McCool Hill in order to keep its solar panels pointed toward the Sun.   The panorama has so far involved over 800 exposures, very little digital compression, and will take over a month to complete.   The view shown is toward Husband Hill, a hill that Spirit climbed last year.  A careful inspection of the above image shows tracks crossing from the center to the right.",
