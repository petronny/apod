  "explanation": "Yes, but have you ever seen aurora from a cave? To capture this fascinating juxtaposition between below and above, astrophotographer Bjargmundsson spent much of a night alone in the kilometer-long Raufarh\u00f3lshellir lava cave in Iceland during late March. There, he took separate images of three parts of the cave using a strobe for illumination.  He also took a deep image of the sky to capture faint aurora, and digitally combined the four images later. The 4600-year old lava tube has several skylights under which stone rubble and snow have accumulated.  Oh -- the person standing on each mound -- it's the artist.",
