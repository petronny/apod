  "explanation": "Have you ever seen a halo around the Moon?  This fairly common sight occurs when high thin clouds containing millions of tiny ice crystals cover much of the sky.  Each ice crystal acts like a miniature lens.  Because most of the crystals have a similar elongated hexagonal shape, light entering one crystal face and exiting through the opposing face refracts 22 degrees, which corresponds to the radius of the Moon Halo.  A similar Sun Halo may be visible during the day.  Exactly how ice-crystals form in clouds remains under investigation.  In the featured image, the ice circle in the sky is mirrored by a stone circle on the ground. Taken just over a month ago in Pontypridd Common, Wales, UK, the central Rocking Stone survives from the last ice age, while the surrounding stones in the circles were placed much more recently -- during the 1800s.
