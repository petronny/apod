  "explanation": "Something strange happened to this galaxy,\r but what? M82\r is a nearby galaxy in the group of galaxies\r dominated by itself, M81, and NGC 3077.\r M82 is thought by some to be limping away from a close encounter\r with M81.\r This galactic collision\r might have stirred up the inner stars and gas in M82,\r causing the unusual dark lanes of dust\r visible in the above photograph. M82\r is a starburst galaxy with a very\r active center containing star clusters far brighter\r than any in our own Milky Way Galaxy.\r",
