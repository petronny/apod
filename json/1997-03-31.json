  "explanation": "It's a weed,\r it's Jupiter, no it's - actually planetary\r nebula NGC 3242. After a star like our Sun\r completes fusion in its core, it throws off its outer layers it\r a striking display called a planetary nebula. NGC 3242\r is such a planetary nebula, with the stellar remnant white dwarf star\r visible at the center. This nebula is sometimes called \"The\r Ghost of Jupiter\" for its similar appearance to the familiar\r planet. NGC 3242 is much farther away however, than the measly\r 40 light-minutes distance to Jupiter.\r In fact, by comparing the apparent expansion rate with the actual\r rate determined from Doppler\r studies, astronomers have estimated\r the distance to NGC 3242 to be about 1400 light-years away. The\r red FLIERs\r visible near the edges of the nebula remain mysterious. \r",
