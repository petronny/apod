  "explanation": "Some stellar nebulae are strangely symmetric. For example, every major blob of gas visible on the upper left of NGC 5307 appears to have a counterpart on the lower right.  This picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope was released last week. NGC 5307 is an example of a planetary nebula with a spiral shape.  Spiral planetary nebulae are thought to be caused by a bright central white dwarf star expelling a symmetric wobbling jet of rapidly moving gas.  It takes light about 10,000 years to reach us from NGC 5307, and about 6 months just to go from one side to the other.  In contrast, light takes only about 8 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun.",
