  "explanation": "The 1998 Leonids Meteor Shower was perhaps the most photographed meteor event in history.  Patient observers saw bright meteors streak across dark skies every few minutes, frequently leaving fading trails stretching across the sky.  High above the Anza-Borrego Desert, a meteor was photographed streaking up from the radiant constellation of the Leonids: Leo.  This meteor train covered over 40 degrees, and changed colors from green to red.",
