  "explanation": "What kind of cloud is this?  A roll cloud.  These rare long clouds may form near advancing cold fronts.   In particular, a downdraft from an advancing storm front can cause moist warm air to rise, cool below its dew point, and so form a cloud.  When this happens uniformly along an extended front, a roll cloud may form.  Roll clouds may actually have air circulating along the long horizontal axis of the cloud.  A roll cloud is not thought to be able to morph into a tornado.  Unlike a similar shelf cloud, a roll cloud, a type of Arcus cloud, is completely detached from their parent  cumulonimbus cloud.  Pictured above, a roll cloud extends far into the distance in 2009 January above Las Olas Beach in Maldonado, Uruguay.   Note: An APOD editor will review astronomy images of 2009, hosted by the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York on Friday, January 8 at the American Museum of Natural History, NYC.",
