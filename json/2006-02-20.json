  "explanation": "Who dunnit?  Like a scene from a space mystery movie, a spacesuit floated away from the International Space Station earlier this month, but no investigation was needed.  It was pushed out by the space station crew.   Dubbed Suitsat-1, the unneeded Russian Orlan spacesuit filled mostly with old clothes was fitted with a faint radio transmitter and released to orbit the Earth. Suitsat-1 will orbit once every 90 minutes until it burns up in the Earth's atmosphere within a few weeks.  The suit circled the Earth twice before its radio signal became unexpectedly weak.  Pictured above, the lifeless spacesuit was photographed as it drifted away from the Earth-orbiting space station earlier this month.",
