{"copyright":"West Mountain Observatory","date":"2018-10-20","explanation":"Not a Falcon 9 rocket launch after sunset, the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae in the sky. Its haunting symmetries are seen in the very central region of this composited picture, processed to reveal an enormous but extremely faint halo of gaseous material, over three light-years across. Made with data from ground- and space-based telescopes it shows the extended emission which surrounds the brighter, familiar planetary nebula. Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a sun-like star. But only more recently have some planetaries been found to have halos like this one, likely formed of material shrugged off during earlier active episodes in the star's evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the outer filamentary portions of this halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years old.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1810/NGC6543-BYU-L.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Halo of the Cat's Eye","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1810/NGC6543-BYU-L1024.jpg"}
