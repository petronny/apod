  "explanation": "The Earth has once again endured a burst of\r particles from the Sun. The latest storm,\r which began Monday, was one of the best documented solar storms\r to date. At 10 am (EDT)\r ground monitors of the SOHO\r spacecraft, which continually monitors the Sun,\r noticed a weak spot in the solar corona was buckling again, this\r time letting loose\r a large, explosive Coronal Mass Ejection\r (CME). Almost simultaneously, NASA's WIND spacecraft\r began detecting bursts of radio waves\r from electrons\r involved in this magnetic storm. Supersonic\r waves rippled though the solar corona\r as a puff of high energy gas shot out into the Solar System.\r The above image\r shows two photographs of the Sun\r taken about 15 minutes apart and subtracted, highlighting the\r explosion. The CME\r gas will have little lasting effect on the Earth,\r but might make this a good weekend to see an aurora.\r",
