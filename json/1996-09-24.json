  "explanation": "If the thick clouds covering Venus were removed,\r how would the surface appear? Using an imaging radar\r technique, the Magellan spacecraft\r was able to lift the veil from the Face of Venus\r and produce this spectacular high resolution imageof\r the planet's surface. Red, in this false-color map, represent\r mountains, while blue represents valleys This 3-kilometer resolution\r map is a composite of Magellan\r images compiled between 1990 and 1994. Gaps were filled in by\r the Earth-based Arecibo Radio Telescope.\r The large yellow/red area in the north is Ishtar Terra\r featuring Maxwell Montes,\r the largest mountain on Venus. The\r large highland regions are analogous to continents on Earth. Scientists\r are particularly interested in exploring the geology of Venus\r because of its similarity to Earth.\r  Information: Thursday, September 26 - A Total Lunar Eclipse",
