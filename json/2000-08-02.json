  "explanation": "The Crescent Nebula is a rapidly expanding shell of gas surrounding a dying star.  In this recently released image by the Hubble Space Telescope, a bright dynamic part of the nebula three light-years across is shown in representative color.  The Crescent Nebula began to form about 250,000 years ago as central Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 began to shed its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind, expelling the equivalent of our Sun's mass every 10,000 years.  This wind has been impacting surrounding interstellar gas, compacting it into a series of complex shells, and lighting it up.  The Crescent Nebula, also known as NGC 6888, lies about 4,700 light-years away in the constellation of Cygnus and can only be seen through a telescope.  Star WR 136 will probably undergo a supernova explosion sometime in the next million years.",
