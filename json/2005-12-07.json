  "explanation": "Can you find your favorite European city?  The above digital fantasy of Europe at Night is a digital composite of archived satellite images taken both during the day and night.  This image is different from what an astronaut would see for reasons including a complete lack of clouds and an unrealistic exaggeration of lights and contrasts.

Nighttime light patterns have been accumulated from the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System.",
