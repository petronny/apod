  "explanation": "Andromeda is the nearest major galaxy to our\r own Milky Way Galaxy. Our Galaxy\r is thought to look much like Andromeda.\r Together these two galaxies dominate the Local Group\r of galaxies. The diffuse light from Andromeda\r is caused by the hundreds of billions of stars\r that compose it. The several distinct stars that surround Andromeda's\r image are actually stars in our Galaxy\r that are well in front of the background object. Andromeda\r is frequently referred to as M31 since it is the 31st object on Messier's list of diffuse\r sky objects. M31\r is so distant it takes about 2 million years for light to reach\r us from there. Much about M31 remains unknown,\r including why the center contains two nuclei.\r",
