  "explanation": "What's happened to the sky?  A time warp, of sorts, and a digital space warp too.  The time warp occurs because this image captured in a single frame a four hour exposure of the night sky.  As a result, prominent star trails are visible.  The space warp occurs because the picture is actually a full 360 degree panorama, horizontally compressed to fit your browser.  As the Earth rotated, stars appeared to circle both the South Celestial Pole, on the left, and the North Celestial Pole, just below the horizon on the right.  The image captured the sky over Mudgee, New South Wales, Australia, including the domes of two large telescopes illuminated by red lighting. A horizontally unwarped image is visible by clicking on the image.   Total Solar Eclipse Today: Times and Visibility | Webcast",
