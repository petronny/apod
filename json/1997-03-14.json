  "explanation": "Comet Hale-Bopp is living up to its expectations.\r Besides the brightness of its coma,\r a comet is typically remembered by the length of its tails.\r As visible in the above picture\r taken last week, Comet Hale-Bopp's\r blue ion tail shows a dramatic extension,\r with current reports\r of about 20 degrees from dark locations. The comet's white dust\r tail has so far shown a more modest extent but appears to be growing\r significantly.  Comet Hale-Bopp's closest approach to the Sun\r occurs in about two weeks, and although it will not get much closer\r to the Sun than does our Earth, Comet Hale-Bopp is likely to tell even more spectacular tails then.",
