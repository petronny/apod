  "explanation": "What will NASA rockets look like in the future?  Today's announcement gave one indication. Today Vice- President Al Gore announced that the Lockheed Martin Corporation will work with NASA to produce a reusable rocket with a remote pilot. Currently designated the X-33 program, the flight demonstration rocket design will utilize only a single stage, cost relatively little per launch, and be ready for re-launch within days. It is expected that an X-33 type rocket will be in use by NASA by the the year 2000. Pictured above is an artistic depiction of the candidate vehicle.    APOD News: RJN to MTU",
