  "explanation": "Comet Hale-Bopp\r is turning out to be quite unusual. One reason is the great amount\r of jet activity at such a large distance from the Sun.\r In the above false-color image,\r no less than seven jets can be seen emanating from Hale-Bopp's\r coma. As a comet nears the Sun,\r it's surface warms causing jets of\r previously trapped gas and dust to stream away from the nucleus.\r Astronomers continue to study Comet Hale-Bopp's\r unusual jet activity\r and wonder how much about the early Solar System Hale-Bopp\r will teach them, and how bright Hale-Bopp will ultimately become.\r",
