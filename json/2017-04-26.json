  "explanation": "Mt. Etna has been erupting for hundreds of thousands of years.  Located in Sicily, Italy, the volcano produces lava fountains over one kilometer high.  Mt. Etna is not only one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, it is one of the largest, measuring over 50 kilometers at its base and rising nearly 3 kilometers high.  Pictured in mid-March, a spectacular  lava plume erupts upwards, dangerous molten volcanic bombs fly off to the sides, while hot lava flows down the volcano's exterior. The Earth's rotation is discernable on this carefully time, moon-lit, long duration image as star trails.    Follow APOD on: Facebook,  Google Plus,  Instagram, or Twitter",
