  "explanation": "What's that fuzzy star? It's not a star, it's Comet Hale-Bopp.\r Not only has Comet Hale-Bopp become\r easy to see in the morning sky,\r it has become hard not to see it. It's that bright. Any\r morning just before sunrise, look towards the east.\r Comet Hale-Bopp\r is one of the brightest objects up. Its dominating presence\r is shown dramatically by this photo taken just west of Williston,\r North Carolina,\r USA. Here Comet Hale-Bopp\r shines above the telephone poles lining Highway 70. Too tired\r to get up in the morning to see the comet? Don't worry, in less\r than a month it will also be visible in the evening sky, just\r before sunset. And it will have a longer tail.\r From the Space Shuttle, Dr. Steven Hawley says, \"Hale-Bopp looks great.\"",
