  "explanation": "\r The planet Mercury resembles a moon. \r Mercury's\r old surface is heavily \r cratered like many moons. \r Mercury is larger than most moons but smaller than \r Jupiter's moon \r Ganymede and \r Saturn's moon \r Titan. Mercury is much denser and more massive than any moon, though, because it is made mostly of iron. In fact, the \r Earth is the only planet more dense. A visitor to \r Mercury's surface would see some strange sights. Because \r Mercuryrotates exactly three times every two orbits around the \r Sun, and because \r Mercury's orbit is so elliptical, a visitor to \r Mercury might see the \r Sun rise, stop in the sky, go back toward the rising \r horizon, stop again, and then set quickly over the other horizon.  From \r Earth, Mercury's proximity to the \r Sun cause it to be \r visible only for a short time just after sunset or just before sunrise.\r \r",
