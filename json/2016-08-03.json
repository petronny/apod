  "explanation": "What if you climbed up on a rock and discovered the Universe?  You can.  Although others have noted much of it before, you can locate for yourself stars, planets, and even the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. All you need is a dark clear sky -- the rock is optional.  If you have a camera, you can further image faint nebulas, galaxies, and long filaments of interstellar dust.  If you can process digital images, you can bring out faint features, highlight specific colors, and merge foreground and background images. In fact, an industrious astrophotographer has done all of these to create the presented picture. All of the component images were taken early last month on the same night within a few meters of each other.  The picturesque setting was Sand Beach in Stonington, Maine, USA with the camera pointed south over Penobscot Bay.   News: APOD is now available through Facebook translated into Catalan.",
