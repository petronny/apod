  "explanation": "Some views of last week's total eclipse of the Sun were better than others.   One spectacular view occurred over Adrasan (near Antalya), Turkey and was captured there by industrious astrophotographer Stefan Seip.   The above digital mosaic caught the Moon in several stages as it moved between the Earth and the Sun.   During the center frame, a total solar eclipse was visible, the Moon completely blocked the Sun, the area became dark, and the magnificent corona of the Sun became visible.   The foreground frame from the same location was taken during sunlight.  The next total eclipse of the Sun will occur in August 2008 and be visible from parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.",
